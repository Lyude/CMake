Deprecate `ALLOWED_UNKNOWN_VARIABLE_READ_ACCESS` :command:`variable_watch`
access type.

CMake 3.0 and lower allowed switching the access type of variable access to
`ALLOWED_UNKNOWN_VARIABLE_READ_ACCESS` based on the undocumented
`CMAKE_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_VARIABLE_READ_ACCESS` variable. Since the callback is
always called no matter what, just with a different access type based on this
variable, the access types are now collapsed into one.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to use the
`ALLOWED_UNKNOWN_VARIABLE_READ_ACCESS` access type based on the
`CMAKE_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_VARIABLE_READ_ACCESS` variable. The NEW behavior for this
policy is to always use `UNKNOWN_VARIABLE_READ_ACCESS` as the access type.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.1.
CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it
to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
